## Project 1: Hash Table
A hash table class implementation that uses linear probing to conduct rehashes.  This hash table was used in a spell checking program that takes a dictionary file with one word per line, and a file to be spell checked.  This program utilizes the hash table functions to execute the spell check by indicating what the unknown word is and the line it appears at.

## Project 2: Heap
A heap class implementation that relies on the hash table implementation from project 1.  This binary heap class is used to execute functions such as insert, setkey, and deleteMin which are used in a provided program that is used to test the functionality of the binary heap.

## Project 3: Dijkstra's Algorithm
A graph class implementation that uses the heap and hash table implementations from projects 1 and 2.  This graph class includes a method to execute dijkstra's algorithm by finding the shortest cost path to each node of the graph from a specified starting graph.  This project also includes a program to demonstrate the functionality of dijkstra's algorithm by prompting the user for a graph that will have dijkstra's algorithm applied to it.

## Project 4: Dynamic Programming
